This is a simple Chip8 Emulator I have been working on to learn more about emulators.
More information about Chip8 can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 or http://www.chip8.com/
I started by reading this tutorial: http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/

For graphics, time, and key handling, this uses SFML v2.1 found at: http://www.sfml-dev.org/
